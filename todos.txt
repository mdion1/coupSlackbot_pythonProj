-any way to delete old games?
-guard: empty deck
-organize coupgame class functions
-set turn order (admin) or "start", deal out starting cards and coins
-get turn order (user)

take out case sensitivity in commands and card names -- done
"status all" returned msg twice consecutively
"you returned two coins" is general msg not personal msg -- fixed
zero cards left "your hand:<blank>", change form to "your hand: no cards" or something explicit
return coins caps at 2 - fixed
numerals vs words - "two 2" -- fixed
"kill card" isn't on the menu -- fixed
correct "steal two coins from" in help menu -- fixe
track turn order, prompt user when it's their turn, "whose turn?" command
sarcastic trash talking responses when you lose a card?

command 'show <card>'

bug--kill card shows card in dead pile but doesn't delete
